## 如何成为一个更好的交谈者

## （how to talk and how to listen)

10 basic rulues:

1. **不要三心二意**

   **be present, be in that moment.**

2. **不要说教**

   **Setting aside your personal opinion. Assuming that you have something to learn, because everybody is an expert in something.** 

3. 使用开放式问题

   Let them describe it. They're the ones that know, and you're going to get a much more interesting response.

4. 顺其自然

   Go with  the flow. That means thoughts will come into your mind, and you need to  let them go out of your mind.

5. 如果你不知道，就说你不知道

   Talk should not be cheap.

6. **不要把自己的经历和他人比较**

   **It's not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And, more importantly, it is not about you.**

7. 尽量别重复自己的话

   It's condescending, and it's really boring.

8. 少说废话

   Forget the details. Leave them out.

9. **倾听**

   **If you can not pay attention to someone actually,  you're not in a conversation. Do listen with intent to understand.**

10. **简明扼要**

    **A googd conversation is like a miniskirt;short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.**

**所有这些都浓缩成一个概念，这就是：对别人感兴趣**（因为别人随时都可能让你大吃一惊）。**keep your mouse shut, and keep your mind&ears open. Always you will be amazed.**
